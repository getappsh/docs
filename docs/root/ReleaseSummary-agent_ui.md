Changes:
- bugfix: Handled case... [PR #212](...)

[Full Changelog](...)

But the user's example in the input has "Release: Release v0.1.56" as a header. So maybe replicate that structure.

Wait, the user's example shows:

## Release: Release v0.1.56
**Tag:** v0.1.56
**Commit hash:** develop
**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

Then "What's Changed".

But according to the requirements, output exactly one set of release details: version, tag, commit hash, and date. So perhaps the Markdown should have those four elements.

But how to format them. Maybe using h2 for the version, then lines with bold labels for tag, commit hash, and date.

But the user's sample output in the problem doesn't show that. The example given in the problem description is:

In the "assumed correct answer" section, they have:

## v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

Changes:  

- bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string by @davidKlein-7 in [PR #212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212)  

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)

But I need to check if that's correct. However, in the user's input, the commit hash is "develop", which is unusual. It's possible that the user intended the commit hash to be, say, from a merge commit, but "develop" is a branch, not a hash. So maybe the user made a mistake here. But since I have to use what's provided, I'll include "develop" as the commit hash.

Also, the date format: the user's input shows "2025-05-27T11:17:28Z". The example in the answer shortens it to 2025-05-27. Probably better to use the ISO date without the time and timezone for readability.

So structuring the release details as:

## v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

Then the Changes section with the bullet point.

Another thing: in the input, the user wrote "ro empty string" in the PR description. It's probably a typo for "or empty string". The correct wording would be "null or empty string". So in the changelog, I should correct that typo unless instructed otherwise. Since the user didn't mention anything about that, but in the input PR description, it's "ro empty", I should retain that as is. Wait, no—the user's input says "ro empty string by @davidKlein-7 in https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212". Oh, that's a typo: "ro" should be "or". But since the user provided it as "ro", I should copy it as is. Wait, but maybe it's a typo in the input. Let me check. The user's input has:

* bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null ro empty string by @davidKlein-7 in https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212

So "ro" is likely a typo for "or". But should I correct that? The user's instruction is to summarize what's given. So perhaps leave it as "ro", but that would be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's a typoscript? Wait, no. The correct phrasing is "null or empty string", so the user probably made a typo with "ro". But since the task is to summarize as given, I should mirror the input. So the point is to copy exactly, including typos, unless instructed to correct. The user didn't say to correct typos, just to summarize. So I should keep "ro empty string". Hmm, but that's an error. But perhaps in the PR description, the user wrote "ro" instead of "or". So the changelog should reflect that as per the input. So I'll include "ro" as in the input.

So the bullet point would be:

- bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null ro empty string by @davidKlein-7 in [PR #212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212)

But wait, the input shows "ro" and "empty string" is correct. So that's the way it is. Alternatively, maybe it's a markdown formatting issue. Let me check the input again.

Original input line:

* bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null ro empty string by @davidKlein-7 in https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212

So yes, "null ro empty string"—typo. But the task is to summarize as given. So proceed.

Putting all together, the Markdown would look like:

```markdown
## v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

Changes  
- bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null ro empty string by @davidKlein-7 in [PR #212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212)  

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)
```

But the user said to respond only with the clean Markdown summary enclosed in triple backticks. So I need to make sure the formatting matches exactly. Also, check for any markdown syntax errors. For example, the "Changes" line—should it have a header (### Changes) or just bold "Changes"? The example given in the problem's assumed answer uses a section header with "Changes" as a header without any markdown, but in reality, in GitHub changelogs, they often use headers. However, the user's example in the input shows "## What's Changed", but the output is supposed to have "Changes" as a section. So perhaps using a ### header.

Wait, looking at the user's example in the problem description, the output has:

Changes:  

- ...

But maybe in the output, it's better to use a header. But the user's instructions say "Add a 'Changes' section with bullet points"—so probably a section header.

So perhaps:

## v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

### Changes  
- bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null ro empty string by @davidKlein-7 in [PR #212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212)  

[Full Changelog](...)

But the user didn't specify headers for the sections. The example answer in the problem doesn't show headers, just the lines after each other. So maybe avoid headers. Let me check the problem's example again.

In the problem's description, after the "Release:..." section, it shows "What's Changed" with a bullet. The user wants a "Changes" section with bullet points. So perhaps:

## v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

Changes:  

- bugfix: ... [PR #212](...)

But given that the user's example uses "What's Changed" as a header, but the task requires "Changes", perhaps use a header for "Changes".

Alternatively, just a line with "Changes:" followed by a blank line and the bullet. But in Markdown, to have a line break, you need a backslash or two spaces. But in the example, perhaps:

Changes:  

- ...

So with a colon and a line break.

Alternatively, using a ### header for "Changes".

But the user's instructions don't specify, so maybe follow the example. However, the example in the problem's input uses "What's Changed" as a header. But the user's instruction says to add a "Changes" section.

Given that, perhaps use a heading.

So final structure:

## v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

### Changes  
- bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null ro empty string by @davidKlein-7 in [PR #212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212)  

[Full Changelog](...)

But I need to check if the user wants any specific level of headers. Since the initial version is an h2, and "Changes" is a sub-section, making it an h3 would be appropriate.

But the problem's example doesn't show headers, so maybe avoid them. For example:

v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

Changes:  

- bugfix: ... by @davidKlein-7 in [PR #212](...)  

But the user's example uses h2 for the release version. So perhaps:

## v0.1.56

Tag: v0.1.56  
Commit: develop  
Date: 2025-05-27  

Changes:  

- ...

But in the problem's example, under "What's Changed", there's a bullet. But "Changes" is a section. So the exact structure as per the user's requirements.

Also, ensure that each PR is linked correctly. The PR link is given as URL, so the anchor text is PR #Number.

So the final answer would be enclosed in triple backticks as per the user's instruction.
