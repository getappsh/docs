### Release... with version, tag, commit, date. Then ## Changes section with bullets. Then ## Full Changelog. No extra lines or headers. All lines need to be properly indented if using Markdown, but since the user asks for triple backticks, maybe it's code-formatted. Wait, the user says "Respond ONLY with the clean Markdown summary, enclosed in triple backticks". So the entire response should be in ```markdown like this.

Make sure there's no markdown in the actual response except within the triple backticks. Wait, no, the user wants the Markdown summary enclosed in triple backticks. So the entire response should be a code block with the Markdown content.

Wait, looking at the input, the user provided an example with Markdown headers and bullets. So in the response, the assistant should output the Markdown syntax inside triple backticks, like ```markdown ... ```

So putting it all together:

The release details with version, tag, commit hash, date. Then a "Changes" section with bullet points. Each bullet starts with the change type and message, then @contributor and the PR link. Finally, the Full changelog line.

Check for any possible errors: contributor handle should be as per the input (davidKlein-7), PR 212, URL as given.

Alright, putting it all together now.
