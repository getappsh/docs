## Changes
* bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string by @davidKlein-7 ([PR #212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))

Wait, but the commit hash in the problem is listed as 'develop', which is a branch name, not a commit hash. The commit hash is usually a 40-character hexadecimal string. However, the user's input says the commit hash is 'develop', so I must present it as is. Maybe in this case, the commit points to the develop branch's head at that time, or perhaps it's a typo, but according to the input, the commit hash is 'develop', so I have to use that. So in the output, the line is:

**Commit hash:** develop

That's correct as per the input.

Also, the date in the input is 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z, but the user's example in their response shows the date as 2025-05-27 without the time. However, the requirements don't specify date format, so I should use the full date as provided. But the user's example in the problem had "Published:" with the full date, and the response in the example has "Published: 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z". However, looking at the user's sample output, they might have simplified it to 2025-05-27. Let me check:

In the problem's sample data, the published date is 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z, but in their own example, they wrote:

**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

But perhaps the user wants the full timestamp. However, looking at the example response they provided, the commit hash is 'develop', and the published date is written with the full timestamp. So I need to keep the timestamp as given.

Wait, looking back at the user's input:

**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

So the response should include that exact timestamp. Therefore, the line should be:

**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

But the user's example in their problem shows the answer as:

## Release v0.1.56
**Tag:** v0.1.56
**Commit hash:** develop
**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

Which matches the input. So that's correct.

Another thing to note: the user's example has a typo in "ro" instead of "or" in the change entry. The original input says "null ro empty string" which should be "null or empty string". The corrected version should use "or". So I need to fix that typo in the changelog entry.

Putting all together, the final Markdown would be:

## Release v0.1.56
**Tag:** v0.1.56
**Commit hash:** develop
**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

Wait, but in the "Changes" section, the user's example uses "bugfix:" but the requirements mention using bullet points. The user's example in the input shows "bugfix: Handled..." which seems to be part of the bullet point. However, in the "Change" section, each bullet should be a single change. The type is typically indicated with a leading word like "bugfix", "feature", etc. So the format would be:

* type: description [PR link]

Thus, the correct line would be:

* bugfix: Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string by @davidKlein-7 ([PR #212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))

That's correct.

Now, checking the requirements again to ensure all are met:

- Output exactly one set of release details: version, tag, commit hash, and date. → Done.

- Add a "Changes" section with bullet points—one per change. → Done.

- Attribute each change to the contributor and link the PR as [PR #Number](URL). → PR is linked with number.

- End with a single line: [Full Changelog](CHANGELOG_LINK). → Done.

- No emojis. → Correct.

- No explanation, reasoning, or repeated headers. → The response is clean.

Everything seems to comply. The user might have had a typo in the original input (ro → or), so it's fixed in the changelog entry.
