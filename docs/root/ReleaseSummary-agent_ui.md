Is that correct? Yes, but need to check if the emoji is necessary. The original didn't use emojis, but the example response did. Alternatively, just bold the sections.

Alternatively, maybe use headers:

**Core Changes**
- Bug fix: Handled cases where footprint or bbox is null or empty string by @davidKlein-7 in #212

**Details**
- Commit: develop
- View [Full Changelog](...)

But the example response from the assistant used bullet points under **Changes** and **Notes**. Maybe follow that structure.

So the final answer would look something like:

## Changelog

### v0.1.56 (2025-05-27)

**Changes**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Bug Fix**: Handled null/empty string cases for footprint or bbox by @davidKlein-7 ([#212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))

**Notes**
- Commit Hash: `develop`
- [Full Changelog](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)

But the original didn't have markdown in the release notes. The user wants the summary in Markdown, so bold and italics are okay.

Wait, the original didn't use emojis, so maybe avoid them. The example response used emojis, but maybe the user just wants clear sections.

Alternatively, use:

But the user said to use bullet points and clear sections. So maybe:

## Changelog

**Details**

That's concise. The example response used a section for **Changes** and **Notes**, which are separate. So following that structure.
