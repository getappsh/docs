Okay, the user wants me to summarize GitHub release notes into a clear Markdown changelog. But the input given is "NO VALID RELEASE NOTES OR COMMITS FOUND." So, there's nothing to summarize. I need to figure out the best way to respond here.

First, I should acknowledge that there are no valid notes. Then, explain the situation clearly. Maybe provide a template they can use if they have real notes in the future. That way, they know how to structure it, even if this time there's nothing to work with.

I should make sure the response is helpful and positive. Let them know it's not possible with the given info, but offer a template or example. Use proper Markdown formatting as per their request, even though the content is just a placeholder.

Check if there's any specific structure they need. The user mentioned headings and bullet points. So maybe create a sample structure with headers like Version, New Features, Bugs Fixed, etc. But since there are no notes, each section would have a note saying "No details available."

Make sure the response is concise and follows their instructions. Avoid any markdown errors. Use backticks if mentioning code examples, but here it's just a template. Alright, putting it all together now.

- An incomplete/unpublished release process  
- A non-GitHub version/commit source  
- A formatting/language mismatch
