Okay, so I need to turn these GitHub release notes into a Markdown changelog with bullet points and clear sections. Let me start by understanding the structure of the input.

The user provided a release named "Release v0.1.56" with a tag, commit hash, and publication date. Then there's a "What's Changed" section with one bugfix entry. They also included a link to the full changelog.

First, I should format the release information clearly. Using headers might help, but Markdown uses ## for headers. Let me start with the main release title as a second-level header. Then, include the tag, commit, and date in bullet points. The user mentioned using bullet points, so each of these should be a list item.

Next, the "What's Changed" section. The existing entry is a bugfix by davidKlein-7 via PR #212. In the example answer, they used bold for the section title. But since Markdown uses headers, maybe I should use a third-level header (###) for "Changelog" and then subsections if needed. However, since there's only one entry, a section header like "## Changes" might be sufficient.

Wait, the user said "clear sections" so maybe separate the main info and the changes. Let me structure it as:

## Release v0.1.56
### Tag, Commit, Date

Then a section for the changes. But looking at the example answer, they used "## Release v0.1.56" as the main header, followed by the details in bullet points under that. Then a "## Changelog" section with the changes.

Alternatively, maybe use "## Release Notes" or "## Changes" as a section after the main release info. The example answer seems to split it into two main sections: release info and changelog. The example uses "## Release v0.1.56" then "## Changelog" as a separate header. But the original has "What's Changed" which could be a subsection.

Wait, the user's example answer starts with the release header, lists the details, then a "## Changelog" section. The pull request is listed there. Also, the example ends with a link to the full changelog. So maybe the structure should be:

## Release v0.1.56
**Tag:** v0.1.56  
**Commit hash:** develop  
**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z  

## Changelog
- **Bugfix:** Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string ([#212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))  
  *Contributor: @davidKlein-7*

**Full Changelog**: [Compare v0.1.55...v0.1.56](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)

But the original has "What's Changed" with a bullet point. Maybe using "## Changes" as a section. However, in the example answer, they used "Changelog" as the section title. Let me check the example response again.

In the example, under the main release header, they list tag, commit, and date, then a "## Changelog" section with the changes in bullet points. The full link is at the end.

So perhaps the correct structure is:

## Release v0.1.56
**Tag:** v0.1.56  
**Commit hash:** develop (Wait, the original says "develop" as the commit hash? That seems odd; maybe it's a mistake or placeholder. The example answer left it as is, so I'll keep it as given.)

**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z  

## Changelog
- **Bugfix:** Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string ([#212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212)) by @davidKlein-7  
**Full Changelog:** [Compare v0.1.55...v0.1.56](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)

Wait, in the example, the contributor is mentioned in the bullet point. The original has "by @davidKlein-7 in https://github.com/..." but in the example, they split into the issue link and the contributor. Maybe better to format like [PR #212] and mention the contributor.

Alternatively, in the bullet point: "Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string by @davidKlein-7 ([#212](https://github.com/...))"

But the example answer uses "**Bugfix:** Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string ([#212](https://github.com/...)) *Contributor: @davidKlein-7*"

Hmm, perhaps that's clearer. So each bullet starts with the type (bugfix), then the change, then the PR link, and the contributor as a footnote.

Also, the commit hash is "develop", which is unusual, but that's what's in the input, so I'll keep it.

So putting it all together:

## Release v0.1.56
**Tag:** v0.1.56  
**Commit hash:** develop  
**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z  

## Changelog
- **Bugfix:** Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string ([#212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))  
  *Contributor:* @davidKlein-7  

**Full Changelog:** [Compare v0.1.55...v0.1.56](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)

Yes, that seems consistent with the example. Make sure all links are properly formatted with the URLs.
