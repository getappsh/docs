## Release v0.1.56
- **Tag:** `v0.1.56`
- **Commit:** `develop` (maybe mention it's the branch)
- **Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

## What's Changed
- **Bugfix:** Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string by `@davidKlein-7` ([PR 212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))

Then add the full changelog link. Wait, in the original, the link is bolded, but in Markdown, it should be a hyperlink. So maybe bold the section header and then put the link. Alternatively, just write "- **Full Changelog**: [link](url)" but the user didn't specify, so maybe follow the original's structure.

Wait, looking back, the user's original example has:

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/...

But in the answer example they provided, they probably converted that to a hyperlink. So in Markdown, it would be a link like `[Full Changelog](https://...)`. But maybe the user wants it as a bullet point. Alternatively, separate section.

Let me structure it correctly. The answer example might look like this:

## Release: v0.1.56

## Tag
`v0.1.56`

## Commit
`develop`

## Published
2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

## What's Changed
- **Bug fix:** Handled case when footprint or bbox is null or empty string by `@davidKlein-7` ([PR 212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)

But maybe the user wants all in sections. Alternatively, the user's example in the query has sections **Tag**, **Commit hash**, etc., so perhaps using bullet points under each section. But that might get too verbose. Alternatively, group the release info into one section with bullet points.

Alternatively, the user's example in the query has:

## Release: Release v0.1.56
**Tag:** v0.1.56
**Commit hash:** develop
**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

So in Markdown, using H2 for the release section, then bolded keys. Then a H2 for What's Changed with the bullet points. Then the full changelog as a hyperlink.

So the answer would be:

## Release v0.1.56

**Tag:** `v0.1.56`  
**Commit hash:** `develop`  
**Published:** 2025-05-27T11:17:28Z

## What's Changed
- **Bugfix:** Handled case where footprint or bbox is null or empty string by `@davidKlein-7` ([PR 212](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/pull/212))

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/getappsh/agent-ui/compare/v0.1.55...v0.1.56)

Wait, the original says "null ro empty string" which is a typo. The correct one should be "null or empty string". So I should fix that in the changelog.

Yes, important to correct any typos. So replacing "ro" with "or".

Also, in the commit hash, the original says "develop", which is a branch name, but the user included it. Maybe leave it as is, but sometimes commit hashes are SHA-1 hashes. But in this case, it's the branch name. So represent it as `develop`.

So the final answer would have those corrections.
