Okay, the user wants me to summarize GitHub release notes as a Markdown changelog. But wait, the input they provided says "NO VALID RELEASE NOTES OR COMMITS FOUND." Hmm, so the actual release notes aren't available. How should I handle this?

I need to check what exactly they need. They might have intended to provide release notes, but there's an error or no data. Maybe they want a template or a placeholder? Let me think. If there's no information, creating a genuine changelog isn't possible. So the best approach is to inform them that there's no data, and perhaps offer a template they can fill in themselves.

I should structure my response clearly. Let them know the issue first. Then, offer a template. Use headings to make it easy to follow. Maybe add comments on how to customize it. Keep it friendly and helpful. Make sure to mention versions, dates, and sections like Added, Changed, Removed, Fixed.

Also, remind them to replace placeholders with actual details. Maybe bold certain parts to highlight importance. Keep the language simple and direct. Make sure the Markdown formatting is correct, using appropriate headers and bullet points. Double-check that the example changelog looks user-friendly and actionable. Alright, that should cover it.

**No Valid Release Notes Found**  
The specified GitHub repository does not contain accessible or valid release notes or commit history. This may indicate:  

1. **No public releases**  
2. **Empty or deleted repository**  
3. **Private or inaccessible repository**  

**Sample Changelog Template** (replace placeholders):  
```markdown
# v0.1.0 - 2023-XX-XX

## ‚ú® Added
- [New feature 1] - Brief description  
- [New feature 2] - Implementation details  

## üîÑ Changed
- [Updated component/function] - Explanation of changes  

## üõ† Fixed
- [Issue #X] - Bug resolution summary  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Persistent problem description  
```

To generate a proper changelog, provide actual release notes or repository access.
