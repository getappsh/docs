## Changes

[Full Changelog](link_here)

But wait, the [Full Changelog] link is supposed to be a compare URL. If no PRs or changes, the compare URL would be from the commit hash to another commit, but since the commit is 'develop', which is a branch, perhaps the compare URL isn't applicable. But the user might expect the link to be something like the GitHub release compare URL, which isn't provided here.

Given all this, the correct approach is to fill in the given details into the specified format, even if some fields are placeholders. So the final answer would have the version as v1.4.0-develop, tag as 1.4.0-develop, commit as develop (even if it's a branch), date converted to May 7, 2025, the Changes section empty, and the [Full Changelog] link as a placeholder.
