## Changes

But that's not valid. Alternatively, maybe the full changelog link is constructed using the tag and commit. For example, using the GitHub compare between the previous commit and the current one. But without more context, it's impossible to generate. So the safest approach is to include the [Full Changelog] line but leave it without a URL, like [Full Changelog](). However, in the user's example, the compare_url is a placeholder. But in the given input, there's no information to fill the compare_url, so perhaps it's left empty.

But according to the user's instructions, we should use the provided details. Since there's no PR or contributor info, the Changes section would only have the full changelog line. So the final answer would include the Changes header and the full changelog link even without the URL.

Wait, but the user's example includes the pr_url, which they have to fill in. Since in this case, there's no PR info, perhaps the changes section is empty. However, the example includes the Changes header, so the user expects it to be present even if empty. Therefore, the answer should have the Changes section but without any bullet points.

Putting it all together:

v1.4.0-develop
Tag: 1.4.0-develop
Commit: develop
Date: 2025-05-07T12:56:14Z

## Changes
[Full Changelog]()

But the date format in the input is 2025-05-07T12:56:14Z. The example shows the date as "Date: {date}", so we should present it exactly as provided, even though it might not be in a user-friendly format. Alternatively, maybe the date should be formatted in a readable way, but the user's instruction says to use the details from the input. Therefore, keep it as is.

Wait, looking at the example again:

Date: {date}

The user's input has the date as "2025-05-07T12:56:14Z". In the example, the date would be written as "Date: 2025-05-07T12:56:14Z" without any formatting. So yes, just copy as is.

Commit is "develop", so the Commit line is "Commit: develop".

The version is "v1.4.0-develop" based on the tag, which is 1.4.0-develop.

So the final Markdown would be:

```text
v1.4.0-develop
Tag: 1.4.0-develop
Commit: develop
Date: 2025-05-07T12:56:14Z

## Changes
[Full Changelog]()
```

But the compare_url is empty. However, the user's instructions mention "[Full Changelog]({compare_url})", so if the compare_url is missing, we can't include it. But the input doesn't provide it, so we have to omit the link. But in the example, the format includes the compare_url, so perhaps it's required. However, without the URL, it's impossible to fill. Therefore, the line would be "[Full Changelog]()" as a placeholder, but since the user hasn't provided it, maybe it's better to omit the entire line. But the example includes it, so perhaps it's mandatory. This is a conflict.

Alternatively, maybe the compare_url is constructed from the commit hash and tag. For example, comparing the tag to the previous commit. But without repository context, it's impossible. Therefore, the answer should include the [Full Changelog] line but leave it empty.

But given the user's instructions, perhaps the [Full Changelog] line is optional if no content. However, the example includes it, so perhaps it's required. In that case, the answer would include it with an empty URL.

So the final answer is as above, with the Changes section containing the full changelog link without the URL.
