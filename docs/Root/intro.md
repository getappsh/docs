# Intro

Let's discover **GetApp**.

## What is GetApp

    -   The purpose of GetApp is to produce a comprehensive management system of digital assets in a multi-network (Multi Domain) and multi-end device (Cross Device) environment. 
    -   The goal is to produce a system that manages every software element in the network space, as part of the "digital transformation". 
    -   The management is carried out in the "app store" model and takes place in the entire network space (stationary and tactical). 
    -   The system allows control of updating software and content to the end devices - whether by push or pull, allows management of the life of the application, obtaining a snapshot of all versions on the various end devices and taking into account the personalization of the device (location, communication status, partitioning, etc.).
